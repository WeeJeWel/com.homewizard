This app let's you connect your HomeWizard to Homey.

Support for:
- Thermometers (Both 443/868Mhz types via the Homewizard unit, not Homey directly)
- Heatlink (control heating)
- Energylink (Power usage, Gas, Solar production & Water usage (via S1/S2), Total usage and production)
- Windmeter (Direction, Speed, Gusts)
- Rainmeter
- Wattcher (the alternative "Energylink" which only tracks usage from the blinking led)
- Motion sensor
- Smoke sensor 

Required steps:
1) Install the HomeWizard application for Homey
2) You must add your Homewizard as the first device before you can add other modules (Heatlink, Energylink etc.)
3) When Homewizard is added you add the next component (Energylink, Heatlink, thermometer etc). From the drilldown box you select your Homewizard device then as a source.
